A mail-order house sells five different products ...

8.11 A mail-order house sells five different products whose retail prices are as follows: 
product 1, $2.98; 
product 2, $4.50; 
product 3, $9.98; 
product 4, $4.49; 
product 5, $6.87.

 Write a script that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows: 
 a) Product number
 b) Quantity sold for one day

 Your program should use a switch statement to determine each productâ€™s retail price and should calculate and output HTML5 that displays the total retail value of all the products sold last week. Use a prompt dialog to obtain the product number and quantity from the user. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results. -->
